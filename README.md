For this project my corpus is the composer Ludovico Einaudi and the albums he has made. When I was little, my mom used to play music from Ludovico Einaudi on the piano. I always loved to listen to them and when I started to play the piano myself I also wanted to play these pieces. I also listen to the recordings of Einaudi's music that are on his spotify account. I listen to them when I am happy, sad, studying, traveling, basically any and every time. You could say that Einaudi is one of my favorite componists. Einaudi started composing in the '80s and hasn't stopped ever since. It is safe to say that when someone is doing something for so long, they evolve and learn allong the ride. Einaudi made various albums all of which belong in the genre minimalism. I wonder if and what the difference is between these albums. Is his style changed? Are there subgenres that can be assigned to the various albums? I wil be using all of the albums and put them in a playlist togehter. If there are albums that have a normal version and a deluxe version, I wil be using the deluxe version. I won't look at remixes or live albums. It is very typical for Einaudi to create themes that are present through the musical piece. He also often adds strings to his pieces. It is atypical for him to use singing in his pieces, but it has been added for some pieces.
